This is a pre-version of this TYPO3-Extension. This extension is not yet available in TYPO3 extension repository because of the missing documentation.

Basically the extension enables you to assign css rules to any TYPO3 page you want. Therefore the extension provides a flexform in backend. So the styling can be done in backend with graphical user interface.
